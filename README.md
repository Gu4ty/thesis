# Thesis

If you are using conda, install the dependencies by following the instructions in [Creating an environment from an environment.yml file](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file)

If you are using pip, create an virtual environment by doing: 
```bash
python3 -m venv <ENV_DIR: A directory to create the environment in>
source <ENV_DIR>/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
